Peter Sokor individual project: "TimeSlotManager"

## Project Description:

## Problem Statement

-For many years, music teachers have faced challenges in effectively organizing and managing schedules for music lessons with their students. Existing methods, such as manual -schedule keeping, paper notebooks, or the use of shared calendars, often prove inconvenient and inefficient. This leads to difficulties in booking lesson times, tracking student -availability, and exchanging schedule-related information.

-Most music teachers also encounter the need to send lesson schedules to students and receive confirmations from them. This process can be cumbersome and time-consuming, especially -when considering individual preferences and schedule changes.

-This application helps music teachers to easily manage lesson schedules, Ñ€elps to keep track of the list of students who have booked time for a lesson and send reminder messages.
