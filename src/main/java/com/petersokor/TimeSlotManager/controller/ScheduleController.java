/*
  This class is responsible for handling web requests related to the display
   of the booking schedule.

  The @Controller annotation designates it as a controller bean,
  and it is used to map incoming HTTP requests
  to methods that perform actions and return the appropriate view.
  this controller is crucial for rendering the schedule page, providing users
  with information about available time slots for booking.
